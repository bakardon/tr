        <section id="SocietyCulture">
            <h2>Society Culture</h2>
            <p>In GIKI, our societies are like workshops for growing as a person. They're not just about learning technical stuff; they're about understanding how to work well with others, a crucial skill for any job. When you join a society, it's like going through a practice interview for a real job. You get good at connecting with people in the industry (that's what we call liasoning). And when we organize events, it's not just about planning; it's about showing off our skills on a big stage, sometimes even on a national level. So, beyond the regular classes, being part of a society at GIKI is like getting ready for the real world, picking up life skills that go beyond the usual classroom stuff.</p>
